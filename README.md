A RESTful API built with Go, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

## Features

- CRUD operations for entities
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Docker containerization
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- **Web Framework**: [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/) - An Express-inspired web framework for Go

## Web Framework

This project uses [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/), an Express-inspired web framework for Go. Fiber is built on top of Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go, and is designed to ease things up for fast development with zero memory allocation and performance in mind.

### Why Fiber?

- **Fast**: Built on Fasthttp, the fastest HTTP engine for Go
- **Express-like**: Familiar API for developers coming from Node.js
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead and small memory footprint
- **Rich Middleware**: Built-in support for common HTTP functionalities
- **Easy Testing**: Simple testing utilities for HTTP handlers

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description          |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| GET    | /api/v1/entities     | Get all entities     |
| GET    | /api/v1/entities/{id}| Get entity by ID     |
| POST   | /api/v1/entities     | Create new entity    |
| PUT    | /api/v1/entities/{id}| Update entity by ID  |
| DELETE | /api/v1/entities/{id}| Delete entity by ID  |
| GET    | /swagger/*           | Swagger UI           |
| GET    | /health              | Health check         |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (if running without Docker)

### Running with Docker

1. Build and start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Running locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export DB_HOST=localhost
   export DB_PORT=5432
   export DB_USER=postgres
   export DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   export DB_NAME=learnapi
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/api/main.go
   ```

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. After starting the application, you can access the Swagger UI at:
- `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
go test ./tests/... -v
```

Run end-to-end tests (requires the application to be running):
```bash
go test ./tests/e2e/... -v
```

Note: If the application is not running or the database is not available, the end-to-end tests will be automatically skipped rather than failing.

### Code Coverage

This project uses Codecov for code coverage reporting. Coverage reports are automatically generated by GitHub Actions and uploaded to Codecov.

To run tests with coverage locally:
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.txt ./tests/handlers ./tests/services
```

To view coverage in HTML format:
```bash
go tool cover -html=coverage.txt
```

See [tests/e2e/README.md](tests/e2e/README.md) for more information about end-to-end tests.

## Database Schema

The application uses a simple entities table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
